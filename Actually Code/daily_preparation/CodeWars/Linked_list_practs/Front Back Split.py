"""Remove Front Back Split
Write a FrontBackSplit() function that takes one list and
splits it into two sublists â€” one for the front half, and 
one for the back half. If the number of elements is odd, the
extra element should go in the front list. For example, 
FrontBackSplit() on the list 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> null 
should yield the two lists 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> null and 7 -> 11 -> 
null. Getting this right for all the cases is harder than it
looks. You will probably need special case code to deal with 
lists of length < 2 cases.

var source = 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 11 -> 12 -> 14 -> null
var front = new Node()
var back = new Node()
frontBackSplit(source, front, back)
front === 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> null
back === 11 -> 12 -> 14 -> null

You should throw an error if any of the arguments to 
FrontBackSplit are null or if the source list has < 2 nodes.
