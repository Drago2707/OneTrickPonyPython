Can you get the loop ?
You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list contains a dangling piece and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the size of the dangling piece is 3 and the loop size is 12:

Notes:

do NOT mutate the nodes!
in some cases there may be only a loop, with no dangling piece
Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.

Don't miss dmitry's article in the discussion after you pass the Kata !!
