"""Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1,
where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find 
a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land 
cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or
water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance:
the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
