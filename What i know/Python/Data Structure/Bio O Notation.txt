The time complexity of a data structure refers to the amount of time it takes to perform a specific operation on the data structure. The most commonly used notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm is called "Big O notation", which describes the upper bound of the time complexity.





Array: O(n) FAIR
they provide constant-time access to elements by their index, which makes them very efficient for certain types of operations, such as random access and traversal. 

The downside is that inserting or deleting elements from the middle of an array can be slow, as all elements after the inserted or deleted element need to be shifted.






Linked List: O(n) FAIR
elements can be efficiently inserted or removed from the middle of the list, because the references or pointers to the next and previous elements only need to be updated

The downside is that linked lists have more overhead in terms of memory usage, as each element needs to store an additional reference or pointer.





Hash Table: O(n) FAIR
The main advantage of a hash table is that it provides constant-time average case performance for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup.

collisions, which occur when two keys are mapped to the same index in the array






Stack: O(n) FAIR/Queue: O(n) FAIR
efficent add + remove
limited use cases







Tree: O(n) FAIR












Array:

Accessing an element by index: O(1) EXCELLENT
Insertion or deletion at the end: O(1) EXCELLENT
Insertion or deletion at the beginning or middle: O(n) FAIR
Traversal: O(n) FAIR
Search: O(n) FAIR
Sorting: O(n log n) BAD

Linked List:

Insertion or deletion at the beginning: O(1) EXCELLENT
Insertion or deletion at the end: O(n) FAIR
Insertion or deletion in the middle: O(n) FAIR
Traversal: O(n) FAIR
Search: O(n) FAIR
Reverse: O(n) FAIR

Hash Table:

Insertion: O(1) average case EXCELLENT , O(n) worst case FAIR
Deletion: O(1) average case EXCELLENT, O(n) worst case FAIR
Search: O(1) average case EXCELLENT, O(n) worst case FAIR

Stack:

Push: O(1) EXCELLENT
Pop: O(1) EXCELLENT
Peek: O(1) EXCELLENT

Queue:

Enqueue: O(1) EXCELLENT
Dequeue: O(1) EXCELLENT
Peek: O(1) EXCELLENT

Tree:

Insertion: O(log n) GOOD average case, O(n) worst case BAD
Deletion: O(log n) GOOD average case, O(n) worst case BAD
Search: O(log n) GOOD average case, O(n) worst case BAD
Traversal: O(n) EXCELLENT

It's worth noting that the time complexity of a data structure may change depending on the specific implementation and the size of the input data. Additionally, the time complexity of an operation on a data structure may also depend on the specific use case and the specific problem that needs to be solved.

Also, the space complexity of a data structure is also important. The space complexity of a data structure is the amount of memory that is needed to store the data structure and its elements. The space complexity of the data structures mentioned are:



It's important to take into consideration both time and space complexity when choosing a data structure for a specific problem.
