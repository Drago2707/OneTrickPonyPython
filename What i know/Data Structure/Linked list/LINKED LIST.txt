Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited for different types of problems and have different time and space complexities for the operations that can be performed on them.

LINKED LIST:

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each element containing a reference or pointer to the next element in the sequence. The elements are also known as nodes. The first element is called the head and the last element is called the tail. Linked lists can be either singly linked or doubly linked. A singly linked list has a reference or pointer to the next element, whereas a doubly linked list has references or pointers to both the next and the previous elements.

One of the main advantages of linked lists over arrays is that elements can be efficiently inserted or removed from the middle of the list, because the references or pointers to the next and previous elements only need to be updated, unlike arrays where all elements have to be shifted. The downside is that linked lists have more overhead in terms of memory usage, as each element needs to store an additional reference or pointer.

Some of the common operations that can be performed on a linked list are:

Insertion: Adding a new element to the list
Deletion: Removing an element from the list
Traversal: Visiting each element in the list
Search: Finding an element with a specific value
Reverse: Reversing the order of elements in the list
Linked List is used in many algorithms and data structures like stack, queue, and many more.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    def prepend(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def delete_by_value(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            return
        if self.head.data == data:
            self.head = self.head.next
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            if current.next.data == data:
                current.next = current.next.next
                return
            current = current.next

    def delete_by_index(self, index):
        if self.head is None:
            return
        if index == 0:
            self.head = self.head.next
            return
        current = self.head
        counter = 0
        while current.next:
            if counter + 1 == index:
                current.next = current.next.next
                return
            current = current.next
            counter += 1

    def find(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == data:
                return current
            current = current.next
        return None

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(current.data)
            current = current.next
        print(elements)


It's important to note that this is a basic implementation and there could be other ways to improve its performance and functionality, but It should help you understand the concept of linked list.
